// public/js/battle/rehearsal.js — the host's side of the delegated bot layout rehearsal (DESIGN §14).
//
// The server hands the match's current host the candidate BattleSpecs of one bot prep (`b.rehearsal`); this module runs
// them in a module Worker (battle/rehearsalWorker.js, off the page's main thread) and answers
// `b.rehearsalResult { taskId, choice }` with the index of the pick — or `{ taskId, error: true }` when this browser
// cannot run it (no module Worker, the simulation data did not load, the worker died): the server then simulates the
// very same candidates itself, at once instead of waiting for its timeout.
//
// One Worker serves the whole tab: it reports itself (`{ t: 'ready' }`) once its module graph is evaluated — a message
// posted before that is lost — and is then handed the simulation data once from the runner's own load (the page already
// has those frozen /data/*.json for its own battles — no second fetch, no second parse), followed by one task at a
// time. A 4-seat match has at most 3 AI seats, so the queue is small (MAX_PENDING_TASKS); a task that would have to
// wait past it is answered `error` for the same reason — the server should not hold a bot prep for work this page
// cannot do.
//
// The server also drops tasks it no longer waits for (`b.rehearsalCancel`: a timeout, a host change, the prep ending)
// and so does the page. A task still running is stopped by terminating its Worker — the only thing that interrupts a
// simulation already under way, a message would only be read after it —, and the next task builds a fresh Worker (its
// `ready` / data state belongs to that instance; the data is sent again from the page's own copy). The task id in the
// frame keeps a cancel from touching a task that took its place. The page drops its tasks itself when the match on
// screen is over (`clear`, wired in main.js) and when the socket is not online — an answer could not be delivered then.
//
