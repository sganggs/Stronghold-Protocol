// Attack-clip pacing for a unit view (render/units.js): the actor's attack clip is stretched over the unit's attack
// interval, so a wrong interval is visible as a **slow-motion** (or rushed) swing — which is what an operator showed at the
// start of a battle: the view started from a base-record guess (`bat × 100 / aspd`, no buffs) and only the measured gap
// between two attacks pulled it to the truth.
//
// The snapshot now carries the unit's real interval (`UnitInfo.atkInterval` = sim `s.interval`, buffs included), and the
// first measured gap replaces the estimate outright, so the very first swing is already paced right.
// DISPLAY POLICY, not a rule of the game. The sim hands over the true interval and the client does not change what
// happens in the battle; the numbers below only bound what this renderer is willing to show, so a broken value (a 0, a
// NaN, a gap across a hidden tab) cannot freeze or explode a clip. `clampAtkInterval` IS applied to every value the view
// takes — snapshot, 'rate' event and measured gap alike — and it is the ATK_MIN_S..ATK_MAX_S window that does it, hence the
// clip of a unit attacking faster than 6 / s or slower than one per 6 s plays at the window edge. [ASSUMED - the window
// itself has no official counterpart; the official client was not measured]
