//
// - The AudioContext is created on the first user gesture (pointerdown/keydown/touchend), so browsers
//   never block or warn; everything requested before that is remembered (BGM) or dropped (SFX).
// - Channels: master → { bgm, sfx, voice } gains; volumes from settings (0..1) + mute. Tab hidden ⇒ suspend.
// - BGM: `intro` then `loop` (1 s crossfade); switching tracks fades out/in (0.8 s). The same loop URL
//   keeps playing across phases (prep and combat share a track).
// - 开战 BGM: `bgm.combatAlts` are the mode's own battle tracks (塞壬唱片 骑士之日 / 无畏者). The track is fixed per
//   round, not drawn: 无畏者 through rounds 1–7 and 骑士之日 from round 8 on (`combatTrackFor`, the official
//   schedule), so every client of a match hears the same one, a fight never switches track halfway through and the
//   联防 that follows a 作战 keeps its round's track.
// - 干员战斗语音 (`audio.voice`, user request): an operator says the official line of the moment it is in —
//   行动出发 start, 行动开始 faceEnemy, 部署 place, 作战中1-4 skillN and the settlement's 结算 result* (battle-only),
//   and 选中干员 select whenever the player taps an operator — in the prep, the shop and the hand too (the owner's
//   request of 2026-10-08 「添加一下干员点击上去的语气一样的语音」, which lifts 2026-10-03's 「整备阶段不需要干员语音」 for
//   this line only). Voices are seconds long and a battle deploys eight
//   operators, then fires dozens of skills, so they run on their own channel (own gain, settings 干员语音) through
//   VoiceGate: one line at a time, a global gap, a per-unit per-slot cooldown, and a higher-priority line taking the
//   channel over — the official scheduling of `audio_data.json battleVoice.voiceTypeOptions` (a tap's 选中 line skips
//   the gap: VOICE_TAP_SLOTS). Two dubs: 中文 `audio.voice` (default) and 日本語 `audio.voiceJp` (settings 语音语言, not
//   tied to the interface language; the owner's request of 2026-10-08 「全套的日配语音」) — a JP line the manifest or the
//   host lacks falls back to the Chinese one (voiceLine).
// - Battle SFX from `b.ev` tuples (`handleBattleEvents`): at most MAX_VOICES concurrent unit sounds, at most
//   MAX_PER_URL overlapping copies of one sound (the official banks' maxSoundAllowed 2), a per-unit cooldown and a
<<<<<<< C:\Users\HPPK\AppData\Local\Temp\prfix-58r98v\o
//   per-unit minimum gap on each file (SfxLimiter), so a 60-unit fight stays listenable. The gap belongs to a UNIT,
//   not to the file: one `b.ev` message is handled in one call, so every event of it reads the same
//   `performance.now()` and a single global "one URL per URL_GAP_MS" stamp dropped the second unit of a pair every
//   single time two units fired the same sound on one tick (实测：unit1 响了、unit5 没响). What limits a file is the
//   official maxSoundAllowed 2, which allows exactly two overlapping copies — so two units may ring together while
//   one unit still never flams with itself. A sound without a unit key (a UI cue) keeps the plain per-URL gap.
// - SFX priority (`SFX_PRI`, the official `maxSoundAllowed` / `popOldest`): MAX_VOICES is the budget of the WHOLE
//   field, so the busy end of a fight used to refuse the one sound a player least wants to miss — while the attack /
//   impact storm held all 8 voices, a 技能发动 / 部署 / 阵亡 cue that arrived on top of it was dropped outright
//   (实测：真浏览器里 tryAcquire 101 次 / 拒绝 31，`{perUrl:29, voices:2}`，技能发动音一声都没播). Every limited
//   sound therefore carries a tier — event (技能发动、部署、阵亡、漏怪) > unit (a unit's ordinary attack / impact) >
//   deco (a generic per-tick battle cue) — and a sound arriving on a full field takes the slot of the OLDEST voice
//   of a strictly lower tier instead of being refused; the displaced sound is stopped at the node, so nothing keeps
//   ringing under the cue that took its slot. The caps themselves do not move (still ≤ MAX_VOICES voices in flight
//   and ≤ MAX_PER_URL copies of one file), and a low tier is not muted: it only never takes the slot an event needs.
=======
//   per-URL minimum gap (SfxLimiter), so a 60-unit fight stays listenable. A `['skill', id, 1]` that arrives before its
//   unit is known is held and played once the unit is tracked (`pendingSkill`): a unit that casts inside its own deploy
//   tick emits that first cue before its `['spawn', unitInfo]`, and dropping it left the one cast silent while every
//   later one played (GitHub PR #292 by @LimitlessHPPK).
>>>>>>> C:\Users\HPPK\AppData\Local\Temp\prfix-58r98v\t
// - Impact sounds (user playtest #4 item 6): a 'dmg' plays the `hit` sound of the unit whose hostile attack ('atk' on a
//   unit of the other side) aimed at the target — once, within IMPACT_WINDOW_MS, and only for phys / arts / true damage.
//   A heal "attack" ('atk' of a healer on an ally, chain heals) never makes the healer the author of the next damage
//   on that ally (纯烬艾雅法拉's heals made every later hit on a healed ally ring her impact sound), element gauge fills
//   and DoTs play none, and a chain bounce ('chain' / 'chainHeal': its first id is the previous target) plays no attack
//   sound of that target. An operator's attack / hit sound that is a skill-mode file of its own (official names end in
//   `_n` for the normal attack, `_d` / `_h` / `_s` for its skill modes — the manifest picked 纯烬艾雅法拉's S3 impact
//   p_imp_gtshpbrnch_s as her `hit`) never plays for a normal attack (normalAttackSfx).
// - The official bank mix of a unit's own attack / hit / die / born sound (`mix`, tools/assets/audio.mjs bankMix; community
//   report #30): it plays with chance `p` — 猎狗pro / 深池侦察犬's attack bank is 80 % silence, so they bark on about one
//   attack in five (never replaced by the generic enemy sound) — at its base gain × `vol`, capped at 1: an official volume
//   below 1 is quieter (妖怪's 0.7), none is louder than before (unitGain).
// - Deaths/deployments follow the official per-class defaults (unitSoundClass): only operators play the
//   operator-knocked-down sound; summons use the token sounds; a summon used up by its own effect (fx `consumed`,
//   香槟炸弹) plays its impact sound instead of a death sound.
// - Buffers are fetched once and cached (LRU); failed fetch/decode ⇒ silent (logged once as a warning).
//
// `bgmKeyFor(route, pub)` picks the track for the current screen/phase (main.js calls `audio.install()`,
// which follows the store).
